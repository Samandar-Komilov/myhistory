3) Chinaz - 16.10.2020 - Fish time

4) Kumushkang - 25.05.2021 - B.A. team trip 1
  We had a full team at that time and 2 cars were needed. During that day, we felt that it was like a year! Especially, Rustam and me tried to learn 'alpinism'). Next, there was such a weather that simultaneous rain and instant sunny! I really liked that travel, we became more familiar with each other.

5) Nanay - 16.06.2021 - B.A. team trip 2
  That was another level. Initially, my parents didn't agree with me, but after Shahnoza opa asked, they allowed. Then, in early morning we started the trip. We spent so much time at 'zapravka', Qo'yliq and they reached the point 1.5 hours earlier than us. Finally, we came to Nanay, but confused one more time(. So, after reaching, just took photos and swam at the 'river'. Another striking point, I learned to cook "Shashlik" there). Then, at 14 o'clock we went to Charvak and walked with boys only. Around 16:50-17:10 we departed from Nanay. Anyway, that was the one of the best trip in my life!

6) Yangiyol - 19.06.2021 - B.A. team trip 3
The initial purpose was Chinaz and eating fish. However, parents of Rustam were not allowed to go, so we returned from Yangiyol. That time was the highest point of "waste" and "happiness" for me and the team. Another words: "Bo'shalgan paytim edi))"

7) Nurota - 12.01.2022 - Family trip
After getting IELTS, I wanted to have rest and we decided to go there. However, at that time I had such questions that "How i continue my learning?", "Vaay, now what can i do without B.A.?", and so on. By the way, i had to give several books to B.A. according to the booking and that was also problem because of the Printing Group.
